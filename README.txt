Although this looks really bad, I swear to God I really did try very hard on this project.
I started with a very complex idea of trying to an eBay type site which I realized was going to be tough
to keep everything straight so I moved into just having a simple Books and Authors website that would allow
the user to look up all the books by and author or to just look up books or authors in general. I spent well 
over 10 hours trying to model my data in Visual Studio (the ORM I submitted a picture of) and continued to get
error after error with my data. Eventually I decided to just put it all in the table to begin and move forward 
with the rest of the design. My website encorated "Admin" vs. "Member" privilages which 
I got help on doing from this link: https://gooroo.io/GoorooThink/Article/17333/Custom-user-roles-and-rolebased-authorization-in-ASPNET-core/28352#.WvC-nExFxdg.
The concept I applied was having a page that everyone can view with the information and also a duplicate of
this page that only the admin could see and enter. This admin page had the ability to create, edit, delete 
data. I agree it was trivial to create the seperate pages, but it met the functionality of not letting the 
users change the data. I had a fully-functioning website up to par with the second tutorial, but did not
have the data being stored correctly. Last night I attempted to fix this so I started making one small change to another small change to
another small change and eventually left was right, up was down, and I could not get back to the functioning
site I had. This was my first time really understanding why I should have made the repository on Git right when
I started the project, not wait until the very end. I wasted a ton of time attempting to get it back but was unsuccessful
so I figured it would be better to at least turn in something functioning, so I restarted. Unfortunately this particular website is a result of my efforts from
last night midnight to 3am and today inbetween trying to prepare for two other finals. I followed the first tutorial for this. Basic functionality includes being
able to look up books or authors in the database. I am typing this readme file at 1030pm so I may still be able to add some changes, but am hesitant to do too much
because everthing I try to do with the project has been 1 step forward and 2 steps back. I am mainly focused on getting admin functionality to work with this
site. I am getting an error different from the ones I got in my other site when going through this and I'm not sure what the error really is. 

I'm not sure the quality of work others turned in, but this was extremely hard. The tutorials make sense, yes, but trying to modify things the way you want them
always leads to problems. I would say I honestly spent about 30 hours playing around with ideas and concepts of how things work but could never truly put it all
together, and then I completely messed up what I could have just turned in and would have probably gotten a better grade than what I am turning in now.
